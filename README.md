# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard is a major company with a large chunk of employees planning on retiring soon. Pewlett Hackard is planning to offer retirement packages to those employees that meet certain criteria, and the HR team has asked the analysts to create two data tables to answer who will be retiring and how many positions will need to be filled in the future. 
## Results
1. There is a large number of high level/senior staff that will be retiring soon. 
2. Future staffing should be discussed immediately with individuals eligible to retire, as many Senior positions will need to be filled via external or internally.
3. This will impact team leadership and onboarding roles, as these senior positions are usually in these roles (i.e ‘Mentorship’ roles in the database). 
4. Priority should be taken in training replacements for team leads and trainers within the current teams.
## Summary
The Silver Tsunami, when a large number of employees leaves for retirement, is a very real factor that companies should be preparing for with staffing and training discussions. This query was created to support teams as these discussions begin. Overall, many positions being vacated will be in a mentorship roll. As they leave, trainings and project management will need high support and additional staffing from internal or external sources.
